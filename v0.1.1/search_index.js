Note that component values are passed as a tuple!\n\nentity = new_entity!(world, (\n    Position(100, 100),\n    Velocity(0, 0),\n))\n\nComponents can be added to and removed from the entity later. This is described in the next chapter.\n\nOften, multiple entities with the same same set of components are created at the same time. For that sake, Ark provides batch entity creation, which is much faster than creating entities one by one. There are different ways to create entities in batches:\n\nFrom default component values using new_entities!. Here, we create 100 entities, all with the same Position and Velocity:\n\nnew_entities!(world, 100, (\n    Position(100, 100),\n    Velocity(0, 0),\n))\n\nThis may be sufficient in some use cases, but most often we will use a second approach:\n\nFrom component types with subsequent manual initialization using the macro @new_entities!:\n\nfor (entities, positions, velocities) in @new_entities!(world, 100, (Position, Velocity))\n    for i in eachindex(entities)\n        positions[i] = Position(i, i)\n        velocities[i] = Velocity(0, 0)\n    end\nend\n\nThe nested loop shown here will be explained in detail in the chapter on Queries, which work in the same way at the Batch iterator that is returned from @new_entities! and that is used here.\n\nNote that with the second approach, all components of all entities should be set as they are otherwise uninitialized.","category":"section"},{"location":"manual/entities.html#Removing-entities","page":"Entities","title":"Removing entities","text":"Removing an entity from the World is as easy as this:\n\nremove_entity!(world, entity)","category":"section"},{"location":"manual/entities.html#Alive-status","page":"Entities","title":"Alive status","text":"Entities can be safely stored, e.g. in the Components of other entities to represent relationships.

In the outer loop, the query iterates the archetypes, and for each one returns a vector of entities and the columns for the queried components. In the inner loop, we iterate over the entities within the archetype and perform the actual logic.\n\nAlso not the last line in the inner loop. Here, we assign a new Position value to the current entity. This is necessary as Position is immutable, which is the default and highly recommended. See section Component types for details.\n\nThe @inbounds macro in front of the inner loop is optional, but it is safe to use here and makes the iteration faster as it allows the compiler to skip bounds checks.","category":"section"},{"location":"manual/queries.html#Advanced-queries","page":"Queries","title":"Advanced queries","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"manual/queries.html#with","page":"Queries","title":"with","text":"Queries provide an optional with argument that filters for additional components that entities must have, but that are not used by the query.\n\nfor (entities, positions, velocities) in @Query(world,\n            (Position, Velocity),\n            with=(Health,)\n        )\n    @inbounds for i in eachindex(entities)\n        # ...\n    end\nend","category":"section"},{"location":"manual/queries.html#without","page":"Queries","title":"without","text":"The optional without argument allows to exclude entities that have certain components:\n\nfor (entities, positions, velocities) in @Query(world,\n            (Position, Velocity),\n            without=(Health,)\n        )\n    @inbounds for i in eachindex(entities)\n        # ...\n    end\nend","category":"section"},{"location":"manual/queries.html#exclusive","page":"Queries","title":"exclusive","text":"The optional exclusive argument excludes entities that have any other then the query's components and those specified by with.
