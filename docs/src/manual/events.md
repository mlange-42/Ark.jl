# Event system

Ark provides an event system with observers that allow an application to react on events,
such as adding and removing components and entities.

Observers can [filter](@ref Filters) for the events they are interested in, in several ways.
A callback function is executed for the affected entity whenever an observer's filter matches.

In addition to built-in lifecycle events like `OnCreateEntity` or `OnAddComponents`,
Ark supports [custom event types](@ref custom-events) that enable domain-specific triggers.
These events can be emitted manually and observed with the same filtering and callback mechanisms,
making them ideal for modeling interactions such as user input, synchronization, or game logic.

Observers are lightweight, composable, and follow the same declarative patterns as
Ark’s [query](@ref Queries) system.
They provide fine-grained control over when and how logic is executed.
This design encourages a declarative, data-driven approach while maintaining performance and flexibility.

## Example

Use [observe!](@ref) to observe for events:

```@meta
DocTestSetup = quote
    using Ark

    struct Position
        x::Float64
        y::Float64
    end
    struct Velocity
        dx::Float64
        dy::Float64
    end
    struct Altitude
        z::Float64
    end

    world = World(Position, Velocity, Altitude)
    entity = new_entity!(world, (Position(0, 0), Velocity(0, 0)))
    ui_element = new_entity!(world, ())
end
```

```jldoctest; output=false
observe!(world, OnAddComponents, (Position, Velocity)) do entity
    pos, vel = get_components(world, entity, (Position, Velocity))
    println(pos)
    println(vel)
end

entity = new_entity!(world, ())
add_components!(world, entity, (Position(0, 0), Velocity(1, 1)))

# output

Position(0.0, 0.0)
Velocity(1.0, 1.0)
```

## Event types

Observers are specific for different [event types](@ref EventType), and each observer can react only to one type.
See [below](@ref combining-types) for how to react on multiple different types.

- **`OnCreateEntity`**: Emitted after a new entity is created.  
- **`OnRemoveEntity`**: Emitted before an entity is removed.
- **`OnAddComponents`**: Emitted after components are added to an existing entity.
- **`OnRemoveComponents`**: Emitted before components are removed from an entity.
- **`OnAddRelations`**: Emitted after relation targets are added to an existing entity.*
- **`OnRemoveRelations`**: Emitted before relation targets are removed from an entity.*

If multiple components are added/removed for an entity, one event is emitted for the entire operation.

\* *Relation events are emitted when entities with relations are created or removed, when relation components are added or removed, as well as when targets are set without changing components.*

## [Combining multiple types](@id combining-types)

Observers can be combined to react to multiple event types in a single callback function.
Below is a combination of observers to react on component addition as well as removal.
The callback is set up to be able to distinguish between these event types (if needed).

```jldoctest; output=false
fn = (event::EventType, entity::Entity) -> begin
    if event == OnAddComponents
        println("Position added")
    elseif event == OnRemoveComponents
        println("Position removed")
    end
end

observe!(world, OnAddComponents, (Position,)) do entity
    fn(OnAddComponents, entity)
end
observe!(world, OnRemoveComponents, (Position,)) do entity
    fn(OnRemoveComponents, entity)
end

# output

Observer(:OnRemoveComponents, (Position))
```

## Filters

Observers only trigger when all specified components (last non-keyword argument)
are affected in a single operation.
For example, if an observer watches `Position` and `Velocity`,
both must be added or removed together for the observer to activate.

Further, events can be filtered by the composition of the affected entity via
the keyword arguments `with`, `without` and `exclusive`, just like [queries](@ref Queries).

For entity creation and removal, only the keyword arguments can be used.

**Examples** (leaving out observer registration):

An observer that is triggered when a `Position` component is added to an existing entity:

```jldoctest; output=false
observe!(world, OnAddComponents, (Position,)) do entity
    # ...
end

# output

Observer(:OnAddComponents, (Position))
```

An observer that is triggered when a `Position` component is added to an entity
that has `Velocity`, but not `Altitude` (or rather, had before the operation):

```jldoctest; output=false
observe!(world, OnAddComponents, (Position,);
        with    = (Velocity,),
        without = (Altitude,)
    ) do entity
    # ...
end

# output

Observer(:OnAddComponents, (Position); with=(Velocity), without=(Altitude))
```

This observer is triggered when an entity with `Position` is created:

```jldoctest; output=false
observe!(world, OnCreateEntity;
        with = (Velocity,)
    ) do entity
    # ...
end

# output

Observer(:OnCreateEntity, (); with=(Velocity))
```

This observer is triggered when an entity with `Position` as well as `Velocity` is created:

```jldoctest; output=false
observe!(world, OnCreateEntity;
        with = (Position, Velocity)
    ) do entity
    # ...
end

# output

Observer(:OnCreateEntity, (); with=(Position, Velocity))
```

An observer that is triggered when any entity is created, irrespective of its components:

```jldoctest; output=false
observe!(world, OnCreateEntity) do entity
    # ...
end

# output

Observer(:OnCreateEntity, ())
```

## Event timing

The time an event is emitted relative to the operation it is related to depends on the event's type.
The observer callbacks are executed immediately by any emitted event.

Events for entity creation and for adding or setting components are emitted after the operation.
Hence, the new or changed components can be inspected in the observer's callback.
If emitted from individual operations, the world is in an [unlocked](@ref world-lock) state when the callback is executed. Contrary, when emitted from a batch operation, the world is [locked](@ref world-lock).

Events for entity or component removal are emitted before the operation.
This way, the entity or component to be removed can be inspected in the observer's callback.
In this case, the world is [locked](@ref world-lock) when the callback is executed.

Note that observer order is undefined. Observers are not necessarily triggered
in the same order as they were registered.

## [Custom events](@id custom-events)

Custom events in Ark allow developers to define and emit their own event types,
enabling application-specific logic such as UI interactions, game state changes,
or other domain-specific triggers.
These events support the same filtering and observer mechanisms as built-in events.

Define custom event types using an [EventRegistry](@ref EventRegistry) and [new_event_type!](@ref new_event_type!):

```jldoctest; output=false
# Create an event registry
registry = EventRegistry()

# Create event types
const OnCollisionDetected = new_event_type!(registry, :OnCollisionDetected)
const OnInputReceived     = new_event_type!(registry, :OnInputReceived)
const OnLevelLoaded       = new_event_type!(registry, :OnLevelLoaded)
const OnTimerElapsed      = new_event_type!(registry, :OnTimerElapsed)

# output

EventType(:OnTimerElapsed)
```

Ideally, custom event types are stored as global variables of the applications.

Use [emit_event!](@ref) to emit custom events:

```jldoctest; output=false
registry = EventRegistry()
const OnTeleport = new_event_type!(registry, :OnTeleport)

# Add an observer for the event type
observe!(world, OnTeleport, (Position,)) do entity
    # ...
end

# Emit the event for an entity and component type(s)
emit_event!(world, OnTeleport, entity, (Position,))

# output

```

Observers might not be interested in components, or in more than one component.
This is also supported by custom events:

```jldoctest; output=false
registry = EventRegistry()
const OnClick = new_event_type!(registry, :OnClick)

emit_event!(world, OnClick, ui_element)

# output

```

Note that custom events can also be emitted for the [zero entity](@ref zero_entity):

```jldoctest; output=false
registry = EventRegistry()
const OnGameOver = new_event_type!(registry, :OnGameOver)

emit_event!(world, OnGameOver, zero_entity)

# output

```

For custom events, observer [filters](@ref Filters) work exactly the same as for predefined events.
The components in the last (optional) non-keyword argument are matched against the components of the event.
`with`, `without` and `exclusive` are matched against the entity for which the event is emitted.
