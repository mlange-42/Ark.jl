# Architecture

This chapter describes the principles of Ark's architecture,
which may be useful to understand what is actually going on,
and to understand performance trade-offs.

For now, see chapter [Architecture](https://mlange-42.github.io/ark/architecture/)
of the Go ECS [Ark](https://github.com/mlange-42/ark), which Arks.jl is a port of.
