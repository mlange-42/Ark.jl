# The World

A [World](@ref world-api) is the central data store for any application that uses Ark.jl.
It manages [Entities](@ref), [Components](@ref) and [Resources](@ref),
and all these are always tied to a World.

Most applications will have exactly one world, but multiple worlds can exist at the same time.

## World creation

When creating a new world, all [Component types](@ref Components) that can exist in it must be specified.

```jldoctest world; output = false
using Ark

struct Position
    x::Float64
    y::Float64
end

struct Velocity
    dx::Float64
    dy::Float64
end

world = World(Position, Velocity)

# output

World(entities=0, comp_types=(Position, Velocity))
```

This may seem unusual, but it allows Ark to leverage Julia's compile-time programming
features for the best performance.

## Initial capacity

The [World constructor](@ref World(::Type...)) takes an option keyword argument `initial_capacity`
to allocate memory for the given number of [entities](@ref Entities) in each [archetype](@ref Architecture).
This is useful to speed up entity creations by avoiding repeated allocations.

```jldoctest world; output = false
world = World(Position, Velocity; initial_capacity=1024)

# output

World(entities=0, comp_types=(Position, Velocity))
```

## World reset

Ark's primary goal is to empower high-performance simulation models.
In this domain, it is common to run large numbers of simulations, whether to explore model stochasticity,
perform calibration, or for optimization purposes.

To maximize efficiency, Ark provides a [reset!](@ref) function that resets a simulation world for subsequent reuse.
This significantly accelerates model initialization by reusing already allocated memory and avoiding costly reallocation.

```jldoctest world; output = false
reset!(world)

# output

```

## World functionality

You will see that almost all methods in Ark's API take a World as their first argument.
These methods are explained in the following chapters.
